# skriptmodtools
Minecraft Skript script for simple commands through items.

WARNING! THIS WILL REQUIRE A SERVER RESTART AFTER ADDING! Otherwise you will be unable to chat until completed

You can see the code as it is open source, plus you can copy it and if you know how to, you can make some tweaks and make your own items that execute commands!
